// int get_freeblock(const char *fname); /* reads the 1st 4096 Bytes (containing n, s, ubn, fbn, ub) from the file fname  and finds and returns the block-number of the 1st free block (starting from the 0th bloc) in that file. This function sets the corresponding  bit in ub and fills up the free block with 1's.  ubn and fbn too  are modified appropriately.  On failure this function returns -1. Please  note that all the modifications done by this function have to be written back to the file fname.

// int free_block(const char *fname, int bno);/* reads the 1st 4096 Bytes (containing n, s, ubn, fbn, ub) from the file fname  and frees the block bno, that is,  resets the bit corresponding to the block bno in ub. This function  fills up the  block bno with 0's.  ubn and fbn too  are modified appropriately.  On success  this function returns 1. It returns 0 otherwise.

// checks the integrity of the file fname with respect to n, s, ubn, hbn, ub and the contents of the blocks. In case of any inconsistency (say, ubn+fbn â‰   n, ub does not contain ubn number of 1's, etc.), this function returns 1. It returns 0 otherwise.
